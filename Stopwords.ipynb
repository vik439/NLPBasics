    "speech = \"\"\"I have three visions for India.  1st Vision: Freedom In 3000 years of our history, people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards, the Greeks, the Turks, the Mughals, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch – all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation.  We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history, and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my first vision is that of Freedom.  I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the War of Independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build upon. If we are not free, no one will respect us.  2nd Vision: Development My second vision for India is Development. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation.  We are among the top five nations of the world in terms of GDP. We have 10% growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognized today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured.  Isn't this incorrect?  3rd Vision: India must stand up to the world My third vision is that India must stand up to the world.  Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand.  Why is the media here so negative? Why are we in India so embarrassed to recognize our own strengths, our achievements? We are such a great nation. We have so many amazing success stories, but we refuse to acknowledge them.  We are the first in milk production. We are number one in remote sensing satellites. We are the second largest producer of wheat and rice. We are among the top five nations in space technology. Yet, I see this in the media: 'India is a hopeless nation.'  We say that our government is inefficient. We say that our laws are too old. We say that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. We say that the phones don’t work, the railways are a joke, and the airline is the worst in the world.  We say, say, and say… What do we do about it?  A Nation of Doers, Not Just Complainers Let me ask you – what do we, as Indians, do about it? We sit back and blame the government instead of realizing that the government is us. We elect them. We are responsible.  If we don’t respect and love our own country, how can we expect others to respect us?  I was in Tel Aviv once and was asked whether we had nuclear weapons. I said we do not need to tell the world whether we have or not, because we know for ourselves.  Strong Nations Stand Tall Take Japan. Fifty years ago, the atomic bombs fell on them. Today, it is a world economic giant. The same can be said about Germany. What changed? Their self-confidence.  So, let’s stop being negative. Let’s develop ourselves. Let’s build India into a strong, developed, and self-reliant nation.  Before I Conclude… I want to leave you with one last thought: What kind of India do you want?  An India where governance is transparent? An India where there is no corruption? An India that stands tall and strong?  If yes, then take a pledge. Dream. Dream. Dream. Dream transforms into thoughts. Thoughts result in action. That is the way to a developed India.  Let’s make it happen. Jai Hind! \"\"\""
